{"artist": "END", "date_photographed": "6/19/2023", "location": "The (now gone) Hall of Fame", "img_name": "IMG_9892", "notes": "This location used to be the \"Hall of Fame\". The first thing you see when you come into town. It had GUROS, GUSH, even TD from NY, and many more. The Hall of Fame getting wiped was what inspired me to start this project. I might have been too late to save those tags but I'll try my hardest to save the rest. The only tag on the Hall of Fame wall, is this END tag. It's been about two months since the wall was cleaned."}
